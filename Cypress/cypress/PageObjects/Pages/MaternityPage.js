   * @description This method verifies the functionality of the Maternity Allowance Report.
   * It navigates to the Maternity module, accesses the report section, and opens the Maternity Allowance Report.
   * Initially, it ensures that the data grid is not visible, selects a date range by entering the 'from date,'
   * and clicks the 'Show Report' button. Finally, it waits for the report to load and asserts that the data grid becomes visible.
   * Throws an error if the data grid visibility states do not match the expected outcomes.
